# TEAM ALMOST-ALL-FROM-MINNESOTA!

# Ideas we are considering:

## Fishing app

Have something a user can search on to help determine where he wants to go fish. "What fishing spots are near me" could be fine, but if there is some other kind of data we can access to help him choose his spot, even better. We give him the distance to the location from where he is (and include a map?), and we overlay what the weather will be for the next week.

We do have to figure out what we will store in localStorage, that is a project requirement.

TO-DO: Find our APIs to get us this information. Weather we have. Where can we get the information that will help the user choose where to go?

## Events in my location app

This is similar to the fishing, but with events. We need an API where a user can put in a location and a date range, to find out what events are going on in that location during that time. Again we overlay that with weather, and potentially maps. Best implementation will allow the user to filter by categories.

TO-DO: Find the events API.

## Birdwatching app

User can give a location and get back a list of birds spotted in that area in the last day (or 30 days I think). We would then overlay those results with secondary information about the bird species. Most particularly: what can I do to attract this bird to my own feeder?

TO-DO: Find an API with any kind of information we can overlay for the user.
