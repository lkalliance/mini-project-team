# Ideas we are considering:

## Fishing app

Have something a user can search on to help determine where he wants to go fish. "What fishing spots are near me" could be fine, but if there is some other kind of data we can access to help him choose his spot, even better. We give him the distance to the location from where he is (and include a map?), and we overlay what the weather will be for the next week.

We do have to figure out what we will store in localStorage, that is a project requirement.

(Still typing...)
